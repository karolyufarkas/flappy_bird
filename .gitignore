# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it's recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries. We recommend that you add the poetry.lock file
#   to version control unless the project is a library.

#   Off course, as mentioned in the comment above, you may replace "lib" with "app"
#   based on your specific use case.
